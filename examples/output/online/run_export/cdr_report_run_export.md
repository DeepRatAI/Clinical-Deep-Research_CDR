### Evidence Synthesis

The evidence for CBT versus pharmacotherapy in the treatment of major depressive disorder is limited and inconsistent. While some studies suggest similar depressive symptom reduction, others indicate potential differences in quality of life. Further research is needed to fully understand the comparative effectiveness of these interventions.
