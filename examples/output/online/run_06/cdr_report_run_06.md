## Executive Summary

This review synthesized evidence into **3 claims**.

**Key findings:**
- SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. [low]
- SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure (HF) compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. [low]
- SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular-associated mortality compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. [low]

### Evidence Synthesis

The evidence suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the certainty of the evidence is low due to small sample sizes, high risk of bias in some studies, and conflicting results.
