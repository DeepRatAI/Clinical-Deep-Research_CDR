| **Intervention** | Low-dose aspirin (75-100mg daily) |
| **Comparator** | Placebo or no treatment |
| **Outcome** | Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) |

## PRISMA Flow

- Records identified: **247**
- Records screened: **189**
- Full-text assessed: **47**
- Studies included: **17**

## Evidence Claims (8)

### Claim 1 [HIGH] ✅

> Low-dose aspirin (75-100mg/day) significantly reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease.

*Supporting snippets: 3 | Context: secondary_prevention*

### Claim 2 [HIGH] ✅

> Aspirin reduces the relative risk of recurrent MI by approximately 20-25% compared to placebo in secondary prevention populations.

*Supporting snippets: 3 | Context: secondary_prevention*

### Claim 3 [HIGH] ✅

> The benefit of aspirin is accompanied by an increased risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding (absolute risk increase ~0.5% per year).

*Supporting snippets: 2 | Context: safety*

### Claim 4 [MODERATE] ✅

> Aspirin's net clinical benefit is favorable in high-risk secondary prevention patients where cardiovascular event reduction outweighs bleeding risk.

*Supporting snippets: 3 | Context: risk_benefit*

### Claim 5 [HIGH] ✅

> Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) provides additional benefit over aspirin alone in the first 12 months after acute coronary syndrome.

*Supporting snippets: 3 | Context: combination_therapy*

### Claim 6 [MODERATE] ✅

> No significant difference in efficacy between 75mg and 100mg daily aspirin doses for secondary prevention.

*Supporting snippets: 2 | Context: dosing*

### Claim 7 [LOW] ✅

> Aspirin resistance, defined by laboratory measures, is observed in 5-40% of patients but clinical significance remains debated.

*Supporting snippets: 3 | Context: pharmacology*

### Claim 8 [HIGH] ✅

> Aspirin use in secondary prevention is supported by all major international guidelines (AHA/ACC, ESC) as a Class I recommendation.

*Supporting snippets: 2 | Context: guidelines*
