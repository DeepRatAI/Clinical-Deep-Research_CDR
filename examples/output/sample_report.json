Meta-analyses demonstrate a 20-25% relative risk reduction in MACE (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71-0.85). This benefit is accompanied by an increased risk of GI bleeding (~0.5%/year absolute increase), but the net clinical benefit favors aspirin use in this population per AHA/ACC guidelines. Dual antiplatelet therapy provides additional benefit in the first 12 months after acute coronary syndrome."
