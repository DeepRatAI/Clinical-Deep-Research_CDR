# ⚠️ Clinical Disclaimer

## Not Medical Advice

**Clinical Deep Research (CDR) is a research exploration tool. It is NOT a medical device, diagnostic instrument, or clinical decision-support system.**

CDR does **not**:

- Provide personal medical advice
- Diagnose any condition
- Recommend or prescribe treatments
- Replace the judgment of qualified healthcare professionals
- Produce outputs suitable for direct clinical use without expert review

## Scope and Intended Use

CDR is designed to **assist researchers and scientists** in exploring published biomedical literature. Its outputs are:

- **Exploratory**, not definitive
- **Machine-generated**, not expert-reviewed
- **Based on retrieved literature**, which may be incomplete, biased, or misinterpreted
- **Subject to LLM limitations**, including hallucination, citation errors, and reasoning failures

## Known Limitations

1. **Retrieval bias**: CDR searches PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov. It does not cover all biomedical databases (e.g., Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL). This introduces selection bias.

2. **LLM hallucination**: Despite verification layers, claims may not be fully supported by cited evidence. Always verify citations against source material.

3. **Temporal gaps**: CDR retrieves from indexed databases at query time. Recently published or pre-print studies may be absent.

4. **Language bias**: CDR primarily processes English-language literature.

5. **No peer review**: CDR outputs have not undergone peer review, institutional review, or regulatory approval.

6. **Population specificity**: Evidence retrieved may not apply to specific patient populations, comorbidities, or clinical contexts.

## Responsible Use

Users of CDR **must**:

- Treat all outputs as preliminary research aids requiring expert validation
- Independently verify all claims, citations, and statistical interpretations
- Not use CDR outputs as the sole basis for any clinical, regulatory, or policy decision
- Acknowledge CDR's limitations when citing or referencing its outputs
- Comply with all applicable regulations regarding AI-assisted research in their jurisdiction

## Regulatory Status

CDR has **not** been evaluated, cleared, or approved by any regulatory body (FDA, EMA, CE, or equivalent). It is not intended for use in any regulated clinical workflow.

## Liability

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE OR ITS OUTPUTS. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms.
